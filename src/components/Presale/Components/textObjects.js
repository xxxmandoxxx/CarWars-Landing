<p>Crypto gaming adds a great new dimension to traditional gaming. You have true ownership of your crypto collectible (ERC721 Token). This allows you to do with it whatever you want to even outside of the CarWars universe. This also makes it possible to generate great value with your unique assets.</p> 
<p>An important part of Crypto Gaming is value generation. We are building a new industry. In the near future we will see the first full time crypto gaming professionals. Instead of driving Uber, renting out a room through AirB&B or day trading Bitcoin, some will be playing crypto games and earn their living while having fun. Our unique game economics will give you the opportunity to discover rare assets which when played right can generate great value.</p>

export const GAMEPLAYCOLLECTTEXT = <div><p>Each car in CarWars has a unique and unchangeable blueprint.
    Similar to some certain cats’ genome, the car’s blueprint determines it’s looks, attributes and abilities.
    Adrenalyn cars receive higher rewards but come with high risk. Some cars even have the ability to travel in time.</p>

    Gain experience by competing against others.
    You can challenge them on speed, horsepower and engine size. Adrenalyn cars get double the experience and prestige but 
    they like to be owned by winners. If you lose, your car’s loyalty and with it it’s ownership will transfer to the winner.
    </p>

</div>

export const GAMEPLAYDISCOVERTEXT = <div><p>
    The more you win, the more you will discover about your car’s blueprint.
    New looks, attributes and abilities are hidden within your blueprints. You might already own the rarest car in the game but don’t even know it.
    Keep playing and discover the hidden secrets within your unique cars.

export const THEFACTORYTEXT = <div>
    <p>When the factory opens, you will be able to redeem your special car. 
        The factory will also create new cars for players who missed out on the pre-sale. 
        It will generate new cars based on demand and not based on time. The factory won’t flood the market and devalue your assets. 
        This game is about it’s players and not it’s makers. Our marketplace and game economics are designed with the players in mind. 
        The factory won’t generate a specific level car until a certain quota of user owned cars has been reach. 
        This preserves the value of the player’s cars which reach higher levels first.</p>

export const ABOUTTEXT = <div>
    <p>Car Wars is unlike anything you've experienced before.
    It will make you reconsider what you thought you knew about gaming, whilst pushing the boundaries of decentralised technologies to do so.</p>
    <p>The cars made here will be yours to keep beyond the game.
    Like all other crypto-assets (ERC721) you are the owner, free to do what you want with them.</p>
    <p>Improving your asset is up to you, but you can't buy your way to the top. You'll need knowledge, skill, 
    and nerves of steel. Challenge others to get ahead, but pick your battles wisely because the consequences can be devastating.</p>
