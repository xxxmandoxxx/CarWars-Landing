                <p><strong >Ether Games Pty Ltd&rsquo;s Carwars is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum Network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a &ldquo;Smart Contract&rdquo;) to enable users to own, transfer, and compete with unique digital cars (each, a &ldquo;Blueprint&rdquo; or &ldquo;Car&rdquo;), which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the &ldquo;App&rdquo;. Using the App, users can view their Cars and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, own, trade, and compete their Cars with other App users via clock auction.</strong></p>
